### About This Handbook

We know that there is a lot of information to absorb on the first days, first weeks, even in the first few months. Do not worry, we know you will take some time to get it all and it's normal to forget some of the things that were said and passed on in those early days â€“ even the old members forget a few things here and there. This is why we have this handbook. Here, in a simple and direct way, you can understand more about our design team, and if forget something, you can always take a look again.

The first topic, Getting Started, it's about the things to do during onboarding. The others topics  will cover our processes, the standards we use, the projects we have and a lot of other things. So grab some coffee and some cookies and enjoy! Then we'll do a test to see if you've memorized everything...I'm just kidding!


Ah, one important thing: we want to hear your feedback! Did we miss something? Or is there anything not so clear? Please, let us now!
