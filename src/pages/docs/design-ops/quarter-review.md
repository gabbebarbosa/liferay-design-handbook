### What it is

It is a method of evaluating employees. In order for the company and its employees to continue growing, we divide the year into quarters, where we make an evaluation and create goals for every 3 months.
Besides the company and leaders accompanying the growth of the employee, he will also self-evaluate.

### How it works

Every 3 months the manager will schedule a review meeting, whether it lasts an average of 3 hours. And in this meeting we will cover 5 topics.


##### 1. Personal Needs & Goals

In this first step the employe will tell yours personal needs and goals, and how liferay is helping in this development process. The questions asked are:

- Being truly honest, are you happy at Liferay? How are you feeling in working for Liferay?
- Speaking in short and long-term periods, what are your aspirations?
- Is Liferay providing a context that is compatible with your needs and goals?
- What would make you leave Liferay today?
- What do you think Liferay or your manager could do for supporting you?

##### 2. Expectations

In this step, the employee will think about the expectations he has for himself, the team and the manager. The questions that should be answered:

- What expectations do you have for yourself? Considering your position.
- What expectations do you think the team has over you?
- What expectations do you think your managers has over you?
- What expectations do you have regarding your team?
- What expectations do you have regarding your managers?
- What expectations do you have regarding the organization?


##### 3. Performance review

In this step, the employee will self-assess in 5 aspects, and the evaluation is:
From -3 to -1 = is not meeting expectations, and something is wrong. This case can happen either for personal reasons or not.
- 0 = meets basic expectations
- 1 = meets most expectations
- 2 = meets all expectations
- 3 = exceeds all expectations.

For each note given, it is necessary to contain the facts on which it is based and what the objectives are for it to be improved.

The 5 aspects are:
- Does he/she have knowledge and experience?
- Does he/she do quality work?
- Is he/she reliable?
- Is he/she a good communicator?
- Does he/she bring positive energy and a heart to serve?


##### 4. Agreement

In this moment, the leader and employer can re-read the performance review for selecting the goals the person will pursue on the next quarter.

##### 5. Motivators

Motivators are cards with various characteristics that involve the corporate world, such as collaboration, feedback, technique, speed, recognition ... where the employee will select the 10 that matter most to him at that moment, placing them in order of priority.
