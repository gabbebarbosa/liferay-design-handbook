### What is Marble

Marble is a design language and components library front-end created with the aim of providing a common framework for building interfaces for WeDeploy.  A guide to design principles, components, patterns and contexts of use that contributes to give consistency and coherence to these products and, ultimately, provide a satisfactory and unified experience to its users.

On the [Marble website](https://marbleui.com/docs/components/avatar.html), you can both find the design components and the code for the implementation.
