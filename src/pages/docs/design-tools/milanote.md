### Boards organization

When we share with our team and developers, it is important to maintain consistency so that when naming the projects there is a connection with other tools in which this project is allocated.
Not all projects need to have all these boards, they can be added over time.

##### 1. Overview

This is where you put brief descriptions of what the project is about, short and long term goals, team members, and more. An example of the Forms project.

##### 2. Benchmark

Where we gather screens, and all the information of our main committers. A good practice is to comment on the strengths and weaknesses of how they solve that problem.

##### 3. Heuristics

On this board, we do a product analysis as it currently stands. You can build on [10 heuristics for user interface by Jacob Nielsen.](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
