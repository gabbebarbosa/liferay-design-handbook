### Layers Organization

In Sketch, we also have an organization of the layers, so that it facilitates the subsequent editing of both the designer who did and others who can work on it.


##### 1. Order

The order is always decreasing. Sketch automatically saves each new layer created above, but you should always rearrange when creating something new. You can use the Artboard Tricks plugin to rearrange it more quickly. And with each screen of the stream you are creating, list it in descending order.

##### 2. Naming

For each layer the naming must have:

```
01-current-page-(action-element)
```

Examples: 
01-home-(scrolled)
02-profile-edit-(hover-save-button)
