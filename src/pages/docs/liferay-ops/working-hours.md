### Clockin

For control of hours worked by each employee we use [Clockin](http://clockin.liferay.com/), software created by Liferay, which stores each beat through the digital point. You can access it through your Liferay email.

### Forgotten Registration

In case of home office, or forget to hit the point, you can fill out a document that should be sent to the Personal Department for them to do the adjustments. To learn how to make this adjustment, read this [document.](https://in.liferay.com/documents/112442/17829985/Regras+Ponto+Eletronico/5a15c172-c337-47bf-8a50-66232276e743)

You can follow the update of this and other documents in the [#DepartamentoPessoalLatam](https://loop.liferay.com/web/guest/home/-/loop/topics/_DepartamentoPessoalBrasil) topic page on Loop.

### Extra Hours

The hour bank has its closure twice a year, in July and December. For positive hours, a payment will be made on the employee's salary and a discount for negative hours.

It is important for the employee to look at the emails sent by the personal department so that they do not accumulate many hours, both positive and negative without the need, aligning with your manager to reset them or taking days off.
