### Manifest

It’s our duty: improving our current product portfolio and insert the Design culture in all Liferay’s departments, either tacitly or explicitly.
As a team, we want to become a reference both inside and outside the company.

### Values

##### 1. Introduction

- Team members must commit to constantly make sure that all members know, understand and commit to the principles described here, in this document;
- A member that doesn’t demonstrate being committed to the team, or do not feel comfortable in following the guidelines should be evaluated by its peers. Team should create an assembly in order to understand what are the issues related to the respective member. In case the team and the concerned member have opposite visions, that member can be asked to leave the team;
- Any guideline written in this document can and should be updated or removed if the team members do not agree with it;

##### 2. Flawless Execution

- All of our deliverables and presentations should represent the "craftsmanship" as a fundamental virtue;
- It should put effort for “craftsmanship” be perceived by the public even when an interface is not finished or has explicit nature;
- All of our projects must meet the same operating guidelines for building interfaces;
- The operating guidelines should be composed of rules as simple and scalable as possible;
- All team members must be able to understand, reproduce and teach, to designers and non-designers such guidelines;
- It is team's responsibility to use the most efficient and updated tools for the craft. All the tools used for this purpose must be easy to use and assimilate by the team members;
- Members who have greater familiarity with the operational guidelines should review the work of other designers. Designers less experienced should always submit their work for correction of another designer with greater experience;
